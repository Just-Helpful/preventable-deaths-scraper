","It became clear during the inquest that the double doors and glazing had been installed in the early 1990's and not in accordance with current H&S requirements.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

-To review and consider the adequacy of such glazing in doors positioned at the bottom of the stairs, throughout other Conservative Clubs in England and Wales to enable compliance with existing H&S and Fire regulations.
- To review and consider the adequacy of the proximity of the doors positioned near to the bottom of the stairs throughout other conservative Clubs in England and Wales in order to ensure compliance with existing H&S and Fire regulations.","On 22/3/22 I opened an inquest into the death of Stephen Geoffrey Preston who, at the date of his death was aged 68 years old.

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Before he was employed as a proof assistant testing new guns, Mr Roberts' prospective employer asked for a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificate. This was provided and recorded no convictions, cautions, reprimands or warnings.

However, Mr Roberts had in the past been convicted of a violent offence for which he had received a custodial sentence. This was the reason for his dismissal from his former occupation as a police officer in the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service).

If Mr Roberts' DBS certificate had correctly recorded his conviction, he would not have been employed at Proof House where he had access to firearms.

It is unclear to me whether the inaccuracy of the DBS certificate was caused by an error made by the DBS or by the MPS.","On 30 August 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Roberts aged 50 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 February 2023.

He had been living at home with a care package of support that included live in carers, up until his admission to hospital he had been dealt with by his local GP practice. He was admitted to Royal Bournemouth Hospital, on the 21st January 2021, suffering from Covid and pneumonia, he was successfully treated.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
There is no evidence that the Dorset Council Adult Social Care computer system Mosaic can communicate with the NHS SystemOne. The Adult Social Care team would benefit from having information about the medication being prescribed to a patient, with the patient's consent, and when that medication was last reviewed. Dorset Council Adult Social Care would benefit from information held by a current or former GP practice as to a patient's medication and how to manage any particular concerns raised by health care professionals or family where a patient is able to independently manage his medication.","On the 31st August 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Derek Larkin, born on the 10th January 1964. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 12th January 2023.","In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 16th March 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
Evidence received during the investigation and inquest (and corroborated by the family) demonstrated that nursing staff were trying to manage and care for patients in the very best way that they could. However, they were hampered in their efforts for the following reasons:

1. Despite requesting additional nursing staff, the Bargeod ward was short-staffed when Mrs White fell. There did not appear to be any documented plan or procedure in place for how patients would be safely managed when it was not possible (because of staff shortage) to carry out the level of care for individual patients that they had been assessed as requiring.

2. The ward is L-shaped and the patients on the ward are managed in individual cubicles. Mrs White should have been in view of nursing staff as part of her Level 4 enhanced care ('observation of cohorted patients'). However, it was not possible to provide the observations that Mrs White required because:
a. Patients were inside cubicles and therefore out of sight of staff and,
b. The ward itself was L-shaped.

3. The Bargoed ward is a stroke ward and one where it is usual to see patients who have a high risk of falls and mobility difficulties. Prior to Covid-19 it was explained that staff would take patients who required the Enhanced Care to the dayroom so that they could be under the required observation. Since Covid-19, this had not been possible. To counteract the logistical difficulties faced by staff in observation of Enhanced Care patients on the ward it was explained that patients are now moved to their cubicle doorway for periods of the day so that they are in sight of nursing staff. This appeared to be ineffective because:
a. The particular care needs/wishes of a patient may mean that is not suitable.
b. That only accounts for part of the day.

4. To further counteract the difficulties with observing patients on Enhanced Level 4 care it was explained that clip-on alarm sensors were used. There was evidence given that patients are able to simply unclip these sensors, rendering the system ineffective.

A Falls Review Panel had noted that Providing Level 4 Enhanced Care on this ward was extremely challenging and that quality care at Level 4 was unachievable in a single room environment. It was noted that the Corporate Nursing Team had reviewed the Enhanced Care Policy in light of the fact it did not fit single room environment, however at the time of the inquest it did not appear from evidence received that a further plan to manage Level","On an investigation was opened on 22 June 2021 into the death of Mary Doreen White.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 01 April 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

Ms Campbell had experienced a work-place related accident approximately 20 years prior to her death when she had fallen off a broken chair at work. She suffered with back pain, which became chronic, thereafter. She had a number of interventions including referral and attendance at pain clinics, manual therapy, CBT and pharmaceuticals.
During her time with pain no clear cause was identified on MRI and other imaging. She was treated for chronic low back pain of indeterminate cause.
Over the years she was treated with multiple, and escalating doses of, medications. These included at the time of her death, diazepam [REDACTED], amitriptyline [REDACTED], tramadol [REDACTED], gabapentin [REDACTED] and fentanyl patches[REDACTED] to be applied every 72 hours.
She was found collapsed at home in her bathroom and there was a possibility of a positional component to the respiratory depression consequent on the long-lie. The medical cause of death was given by the pathologist[REDACTED] as 1a Central Respiratory Depression 1b Tramadol excess with fentanyl II Long lie following a fall, chronic post traumatic back injury.
The police and paramedics attending the scene describe the finding of ""hundreds"" of packets of medications, some opened, some unopened.
This polypharmacy was identified by the pathologist who conducted the post mortem (taking from the toxicology report) as ""In summary, excess Tramadol [REDACTED] and a metabolite [REDACTED] are indicative of recent moderately excessive ingestion prior to death. Although lower than levels typically seen in fatalities, the moderate excess in conjunction with other prescribed drugs, most notably fentanyl are sufficient to have produced central respiratory depression. No other significant post mortem findings were noted, and the prolonged lie following a fall may well have contributed a postural component to the respiratory depression""
Her GP [REDACTED] gave clear and candid evidence. I accept the management of patients who describe intractable debilitating pain is challenging and difficult and that requests for other or increasing doses of medication can be difficult to resist.[REDACTED] agreed that the prescribing of the various drugs identified had potential to be dangerous. He told me that after a certain point the benefits of increasing or adding doses or medications in terms of pain relief were minimal. This scenario seems to be an invidious one for GP's and patients alike.
[REDACTED] told me that subsequent to Ms Campbell's death the practice had convened and discussed the circumstances and agreed on regular reviews for patients taking these sorts of medication. There were no plans identified to actively look for these patients and to work to rationalize and / or reduce their medications.
I am of the view that polypharmacy including gabapentinoids and opiates represents a severe safety risk in patients with a iatrogenic drug dependency. I consider that the risk in individuals like Ms Campbell of an inadvertent overdose of medications which have a cumulative and synergistic effect to depress the central nervous system can easily become extreme and lead to death. There have been a number of deaths in the Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire and Luton areas related to concomitant use of high dose and combination gabapentinoids and opioids.","On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Sharman CAMPBELL aged 56.

At about 09:15rs on Monday 31st May 2021 officers have been made aware of a concern for the wellbeing of PS DUIGNAN and they have been asked to make a search of the airport policing unit offices located at Percival Way Luton.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.
The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.
Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter[REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.
Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was[REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed - incorrectly - single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Sean's access had been restricted she would not, I am
certain, have allowed him entry.","On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sean Gerard DUIGNAN aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Sean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury. He took a hand gun and ammunition, entered the base gym and shot himself in the head.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 13, 2023.

Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The inquest has highlighted an ongoing concern that Oncology Consultants will continue to be the lead Consultants for care of APML patients at Alder Hey Trust. The most significant risk of death in such patients is due to the risk of serious bleeding due to the associated and significant coagulopathy. Coagulopathy management should be led by a Haematologist to prevent future deaths due to this issue, that was recognised by a Consultant Haematologist who gave evidence to the inquest as a expert witness and as supported by a leading Haematologist at the Trust. There is nationally a shortage of Haematologists which leaves Alder Hey Trust without resources available to them to address this matter of concern or to recruit.","","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by July 21, 2022.

Mental health patient absconder and missing person from St Marys Hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
Chris was known to abscond from secure mental health detention during periods of ""escorted leave"". He had left the care of the Trust on 6 occasions during his final 3 month detention and was known to purchase and take illicit drugs on these occasions. His Consultant had discussed this high risk behaviour with him on many occasions.

(1) The Consultant Psychiatrist had signed the agreed escorted leave form on the basis that Chris would be accompanied 1:1 with a nurse. The purpose of the leave was therapeutic, to enable Chris to access the community in a supported manner. Evidence was before the court that the leave was only to the adjacent car park, to facilitate a smoking break, and 1 member of staff accompanied up to 6 patients. The Trust's own Root Cause Analysis report confirms that the practise was at this time for 1 staff member to accompany those patients who wished to smoke to the adjacent carpark.

(2) The car park is entirely unsecure and open to the road. Evidence given in court was that the hospital site is non-smoking, but the evidence was unclear whether the car park was considered to be part of the hospital site or separate.

(3)My concern is that there has been a tolerated blurring of the boundaries between the intentions of escorted leave for individuals under a MHA section, and the ward staff's ability to facilitate this in a meaningful and therapeutic way to benefit the patients, and that the clinical staff were not aware of this. Chris had indicated his desire to access the cash point and buy Christmas presents for his family, but there was no suggestion these requests had been considered by the Trust and either approved or refused. Chris therefore made the decision to leave the ward, with catastrophic consequences. Has the Trust given any consideration to the provision of a ""safe"" smoking area that patients can access without the need to be accompanied or to use their restricted escorted leave for this purpose alone?","On 31 December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Thomas Ace RYAN. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11 April 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

He had attended on the 9th July 2022 after visiting the nearby Urgent Care Centre (UCC) and being referred to ED by the GP there. He was provided with a printout of his consultation with her. She was worried about him. That communication detailed his complaint of loose stools and abdominal pain. The triage nurse did not record the content of the UCC letter accurately and took that letter from Mr Blewitt. He later saw the ED doctor who did not see or read the UCC letter or attempt to source it. The ED doctor did not record any questions relating to bowel habit on his contemporaneous note, but sometime subsequent to Mr Blewitt's death wrote a statement in which he identified that he had and that there were no bowel complaints. This was despite several days of being faecally incontinent at home and highlighting this to the UCC doctor. The ED doctor sent him home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant or recurrent urinary tract infection even though the MSU taken by his GP a few days earlier and available to the UCC doctor showed no growth. Mr Blewitt, even though he was sent home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant urinary tract infection on the 9th July 2022, was told to continue the original antibiotics his GP had started him on and then to start the new ones the next day. Mr Blewitt spent a difficult two days with faecal incontinence and abdominal pain before returning on the 11th July 2022 to the ED. At this visit a possible acute abdomen was diagnosed and CT scanning confirmed this. He was taken to theatre and suffered a cardiac arrest before surgery and died the next day on ITU. It emerged in evidence that there were no reliable records of any fluid resuscitation in the ED available for examination. This is because the computerised system records the prescription of IV fluids but unless the prescription is signed, that prescribed item is erased. The best information I received was that he had received two litres of an unknown fluid at some point during his time in the ED. It seems that doctors were not as a routine signing the prescriptions and so no reliable record was retained. I was told that doctors had been reminded on the need to sign prescriptions but no audit of this had been carried out since Mr Blewitt's death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

[1] At the time of Mr Blewitt's death there was no effective, reliable recording of intravenous fluids administered to patients in the emergency department. That in my view has potential to represent a threat to the safety and lives of patients suffering with a wide variety of different conditions. The author of the SI report who attended to give evidence did not, at the time of Inquest 8 months later, was unable to demonstrate that the Trust had remedied that.
[2] Despite the 8 month interval between Mr Blewitt's death and the Inquest the issues of concern had not been brought to the attention of hospital authorities.
[3] On arrival at the ED a triage nurse summarised the communication from the urgent care centre. The triage nurse missed important points during the transcription. The attending doctor did not concern himself to look at the communication himself.
[4] I was concerned that the treating doctor made a contemporaneous note on the 9th July 2022 at Mr Blewitt's first presentation which failed to record the major presenting symptom, diarrhoea with faecal incontinence, which Mr Blewitt had communicated to the urgent care doctor who in turn had included that in her notes and letter to the ED. The treating doctor did record a flatly contradictory note to the effect there was no change in bowel habit.
[5] The Incident Investigation Report which is in part designed to assist with learning from adverse events was of a generally poor standard. There was a failure to consider issues in detail; there was a failure to challenge the statements of clinicians where there were obvious contradictions between statements made and the medical record; there was a failure to put in place measures to correct and monitor prescribing clinicians failure to sign off on IV fluid prescriptions so that the contemporaneous record would be available for clinicians coming after them and they could see whether a patient had satisfactory or unsatisfactory fluid management. The only record in the case was a typed note by a junior doctor to the effect that it was thought Mr Blewitt had received 2 litres of fluid since arrival.","On 20 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Shone BLEWITT aged 48. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:  ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by July 24, 2023.

Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013."

of alcohol in his blood at the time of his death, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
As a result he was vulnerable and his physical health was deteriorating. Following a
Care Act assessment on 7th September 2020 social services determined that the
Deceased required placement with 24-hour care appropriate to meet his care and
support needs. A referral was made to the Extra Care Housing team in order that a
suitable placement be found. In the meantime the Deceased was placed in supported
accommodation provided by Supported Independence Limited. The services provided
Supported Independence Limited were registered with the Care Quality Commission
(CQC). However, the Deceased's accommodation was a small flat within a single
building comprising a number of similar fiats. The building was licensed with the local
authority as a house in multiple occupation (HMO) and therefore was not within the
remit of the CQC.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.","On 9th December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr. Christopher Evans age 56 years.

The conclusion was that the medical cause of death was
l(a) Acute myocardial ischaemia; 
1(b) Coronary Artery Atheroma and immersion in hot water

cardiac event following immersion in very hot water'","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your

1a sudden cardiac death
1b metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ileocaecal valve and coronary artery atheroma
2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and atrial fibrillation","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

You provided a statement regarding the care given to Ms Coogan by you and your colleagues at the Ritchie Street Group Practice. In it, you said that she reported to Dr [REDACTED] in July 2022 that she had had abdominal cramps present for months, with alternating loose stool and constipation. You said that a qFIT tool test for blood was requested but there was no subsequent result. You said the same about the qFIT requested on 13 September 2022.

It was not clear to me why there were no qFIT results but, given the cause of Ms Coogan's death, that seems to me to be a matter worthy of your investigation, particularly in case there is some system issue.","On 27 October 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Helen Coogan aged 77 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. I made a determination at inquest as follows.

""Helen Coogan died in October 2022 from a natural cause, being cancer. She first sought advice from her general practitioner regarding related symptoms in July 2022, but there was no result from the qFIT (faecal immunochemical test) ordered.""","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 3 July 2023.

","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local Mental Health Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust).

As a result of their employment status the Mental Health Liaison team (who have the best knowledge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). If a patient decides to abscond from the Acute Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detain/hold the patient. They would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately in a busy A&E. By that time the patient would have been long gone.

Due to this technical issue around the employment status of the Mental Health Team, those suffering with a deteriorating mental health in an acute setting are at risk in these circumstances.","On 30th July 2020 Ms Hamilton-Deeley, the former Senior Coroner, commenced an investigation into the death of Rachel Kathleen Garrett aged 22 years. The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 2nd June 2023. The conclusion given was a narrative conclusion namely:  ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22nd August 2023 I, the coroner, may extend the period.

At approximately 3pm on 11 June 2020, she was on s17 escorted leave, standing with a healthcare assistant (HCA) at the front gates of the hospital having a cigarette, when she turned to the HCA, said ""I'm sorry I have to do this to you"" and ran away.

ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a nearby park.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.

That means more than simply a change in policy wording.","On 16 June 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Heather Findlay, aged 28 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today.

At inquest, the jury came to a conclusion of death by suicide, making a narrative determination that I now attach, and giving a medical cause of death of:

1a hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 
1b sodium nitrate toxicity","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7 August 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows 

This is a further Report, of several by me, as both Senior Coroner for North West Wales and Assistant Coroner for North Wales East & Central relating to matters of ambulance delays and inability to offload patients in a timely manner into Emergency Departments across North Wales.

Evidence was heard at the Inquest that the initial delays experienced by Mary Elizabeth Jones whilst awaiting an ambulance and waiting in the rear of the ambulance possibly contributed indirectly to her existing frailty. Whilst not in themselves causative of Mrs Jones' death it remains a significant concern that despite evidence of improvements by the Health Board and WAST upon which I have previously been provided, that even as recently as December 2022, unacceptably lengthy delays remain such as in the case of Mary Elizabeth Jones.

I have still not been presented with any meaningful evidence on the involvement of Local Authorities in the considerations by WAST and BCUHB of lack of patient flow due to social care deficiencies.","On 19 January 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Mary Elizabeth Jones (DOB 30/12/36) who died on 14 January 2023. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 July 2023. ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 4 September 2023. I, Kate Robertson, the Coroner, may extend the period.

I am willing to accept a joint response from all to whom this Report is made.

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013."

On the 10 July 2022 he also presented with lower abdominal pain, lower back pain and pain in the top of his right leg. He was recognised as being critically unwell and the emergency department requested transfer to the intensive care unit. There was a delay in transferring Matthew to intensive care. He should have been transferred by 2230 on the 10 July 2022, but was not transferred until 0930 on the 11 July 2023. Matthew's family observed that only one of two bottles of antibiotics prescribed to Matthew in A&E were administered to him. Matthew was not observed as closely as he should have been, given his very concerning clinical condition and there were delays in carrying out necessary blood tests and in commencing renal replacement therapy. The inquest has found however that Matthew presented to hospital on the 10 July 2022 with a likely acute kidney injury, associated with sepsis. As such, his prognosis was very poor, even with optimal treatment. There is no evidence that the failings in the care provided to him contributed to his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the lack of a contingency plan in place to ensure that intensive care is provided to all patients who require it, but where the intensive care unit itself is full. The Inquest heard evidence from an independent consultant anaesthetist who stated:

I do not understand why one or two of the 8 ICU patients who were deemed to be wardable, could not have been moved elsewhere (e.g. to a post anaesthetic care unit in an operating suite), to enable a sick patient such as Mr Phipps to be admitted to the ICU. It is my understanding that most ICUs have such contingency plans in place, in the form of agreed standard operating procedures.

The Trust were aware of this concern, but did not provide any evidence to address this.","On 4 October 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Matthew John Phipps, aged 56 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 26 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Phipps died from natural causes.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25 August 2023.
